# Finance for Freelancers
## JS code for common financial equations
### Ideas (Brainstorm)
— *Net Present Value (NPV)*
— *Internal Rate of Return (IRR)*
— *Free Cash Flow (FCF)*
— *Portfolio Allocation: Stocks vs. Bonds*
— *Should I Buy/Rent? (city rent data compared w/ mortgage rates)*
— *Savings Calculator*: If you're saving up for a trip or w/e, here's how much you need to put away every day/week/month. We could integrate this with daily "eyes on the prize" email reminders of how close you are to your savings goal.

```javascript
console.log("Matt -- feel free to fork/add to these lists.")
```

### Blog Ideas
— Passive Investment Strategy (no-thinking needed has some appeal for many non-technical freelancers)
— *OR* get this: a whole online book/crash course in basic financial literacy for freelancers. Financial Literacy in 20 hours, or 2 weeks, or whatever. We could do whole skillshare model on its own site.
